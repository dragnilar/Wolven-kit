# Wolven-kit

This is a fork of Traderain's Wolven-kit that contains several tweaks/modifications that which are to my own liking. This is not intended to be merged back with the main branch.

Examples of changes include:

- Hot key(s) for packing mods since I prefer to use Wolven-Kit for packing and wanted to expedite the process.
- Stand Alone version of the String Encoder GUI since I have to make a lot of string changes for my own mod.
- Changed a couple instances of the Folder Selection Dialog that Tradearin was using so that it is using the Vista Folder Browser dialog instead of the old XP style dialog.
- "Fixed" a few spots where Wolven-kit throws errors when it should be doing shell executes (I.E. image, witcher script files).
- Upgraded to target .NET 4.8, I did not see any reason to leave it on 4.6.x.
